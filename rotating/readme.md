** Problem **

Given a rotated sorted list that was rotated some unknown number of times, we need to find the number of times it was rotated.

- `Nums` rapresents a sorted rotated list. Example: `[8,9,13,3,5,7]`
- `Rotations` rapresents the numbers of time the sorted list was rotated. Example: `3`


### Algorithm explained
- Check for each number in the list whether it is smaller than the number that comes before it
